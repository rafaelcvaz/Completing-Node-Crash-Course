## Description
Hello, my name is Rafael Vaz. I'm a Biological Sciences student in Brazil changing areas to programming. I have some experience in bioinformatics, but only simple concepts that I want to develop.
I'm completing the [Node Crash Course]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcQyJ-gxke0&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jx2TTZk3IGWKSbtugYdrlu&index=1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zb3Qk8SG5Ms&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jsz4LDYc6kv3ymONOKxwBU)) in this repository to help me focus and learn the basics of Node Js.
